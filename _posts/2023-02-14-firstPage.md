# My Journey as a Data Professional

As I sit down to write about my journey, I am struck by how far I have come. My name is Suchat Tangjarukij, and I am a data professional from Thailand with a deep passion for artificial intelligence.

## Technical Foundation

My journey began as a robotics engineer, where I gained a fundamental understanding of how things operate at a technical level. This technical foundation has been invaluable in my work, allowing me to see the possibilities in even the most complex systems.

## Proud Achievements

One of my proudest achievements was the development of an online learning algorithm at Allianz Thailand, which changed the company's data management processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This innovative technology helped Allianz navigate the pandemic's challenges while providing vital services to its customers.

My passion for technology has also led me to EATLAB, where I contributed to the installation of Cloud AI cameras in Bangkok and Singapore. These cameras are now instrumental in keeping people safe and secure in those cities, and I am proud to have been a part of that effort.

## Fun and Hobbies

Despite my technical background, I am also someone who loves to have fun. I have a great sense of humor and love to play strategy games with simple rules. And although I enjoy playing the guitar, I am the first to admit that I am not very good at it.

## Gratitude and Excitement

Looking back at my journey, I am filled with a sense of gratitude for the opportunities I have had and the amazing people I have met along the way. I am excited about the future and can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!
